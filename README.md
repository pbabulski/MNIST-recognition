# MNIST-recognition
The subject of the project is a comparison of deep learning algorithms in a system with a PLC controller. 
Deep learning algorithms were built with the help of the Python language and Keras library. 
CNNs were used to recognize images from the MNIST set and coupled to a system with a PLC controller. 
The communication between the computer and PLC has been completed using the snap7 library.
